# 🐶 Autonomous Pet Feeder

> A full-stack smart pet feeding system with custom hardware, iOS app control, and Siri voice integration.

## 🚀 TL;DR  
I built an **automated pet feeder** that dispenses food either via a **mobile app** or by saying **“Hey Siri, feed my dog.”**  
The system integrates embedded hardware with a real-time Firebase backend and a custom-designed iOS app made with React Native.

## 🧩 Problem / 💡 Solution

**Problem:** Busy pet owners often forget or struggle to keep consistent feeding schedules.  
**Solution:** An app-connected IoT feeder that allows for **remote**, **scheduled**, and **voice-triggered** feeding — even while away.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **App Interface**  
   - Built with React Native, the app allows users to view pets, check storage, and trigger feeding.

2. **Backend & Communication**  
   - Firebase handles real-time updates. The microcontroller constantly listens for signal changes via the Realtime Database.

3. **Hardware & Feeding Mechanism**  
   - An Arduino controls a stepper motor that dispenses food. Manual overrides are supported with a physical button.

4. **Siri Integration**  
   - Using iOS Shortcuts, I linked a voice command to update Firebase, which then instantly triggers feeding from the hardware side.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Firebase's real-time sync is perfect for hardware triggers but needs debounce logic to avoid multiple feeds.  
- Integrating with Siri Shortcuts was surprisingly seamless — but requires careful setup of iOS intents.  
- Designing an intuitive pet UI involved iterating through 5+ background + button combinations.

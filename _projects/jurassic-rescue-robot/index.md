The Jurassic Rescue Robot was built for a mechatronics design challenge. The robot:
- Navigated autonomously using ultrasonic sensors
- Switched to manual mode for object retrieval
- Opened gates via mechanical actuation
- Used a vertical clamping plow for secure pickup

🏆 **Award:** People’s Choice Winner  
📏 Built with strict mechanical and software constraints including 3-servo limit, custom parts, and minimal 3D printing.

## üß† Why I Built This

Receptionists are often the first point of contact for a business ‚Äî but most chatbots today are limited to static FAQs and clunky interfaces.

**This project reimagines that role using cutting-edge generative AI:**
- It understands natural spoken language using Whisper (OpenAI)
- It‚Äôs trained on real company knowledge using LangChain and FAISS
- It speaks back fluently using ElevenLabs TTS
- It‚Äôs adaptable to any company, instantly becoming their voice

> This was my first-ever project in AI/ML, and I completed it solo in just 4 weeks ‚Äî from idea to deployment-ready prototype.
